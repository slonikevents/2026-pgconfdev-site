<h1>Travel Sponsorship Program</h1>

<p>
  This program seeks to make PGConf.dev attendance affordable for those who
  can’t easily pay to travel and attend. By default, sponsorship includes a
  complimentary registration and a hotel room in the conference affiliated hotel
  block. In some circumstances, we may be able to subsidize flights.
</p>

<h2>Eligibility Criteria</h2>
<p>
  Sponsorship recipients should be those whose employers can’t or won’t pay for
  them to attend and should fall into one of the following categories:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Speakers with an accepted session</li>

  <li>
    People who play an important role in the community (e.g. maintainer of an
    important ecosystem project
  </li>
  <li>
    People who play an important role in organizing the conference (e.g
    organizing committee member)
  </li>
  <li>
    People identified as up-and-coming hackers or community organizers who the
    community wants to sponsor and encourage to become more involved.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Application</h2>
<p>
  Sponsorship applicants should complete the <a href="https://www.example.com"

  decisions are announced, the Travel Sponsorship Committee will review applications
  and notify applicants of their decisions within one week. Sponsorships will be
  awarded based on merit, up to the total travel sponsorship budget. If funds remain
  after the initial round, additional applications will be considered on a rolling,
  first-come, first-served basis.
