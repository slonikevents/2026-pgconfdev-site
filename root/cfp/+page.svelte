<p><em>Deadline: January 16, 2026</em></p>

<p>
  Presentations are structured sessions where community members share knowledge,
  experiences, or new ideas with the PostgreSQL community. They come in two main
  formats:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>25-Minute Talks</strong> – Short overviews highlighting specific contributions,
    proof-of-concept work, demos, and investigations or concise summaries and insights
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>50-Minute Talks</strong> – Deeper explorations, narratives, or educational
    content with a clear story arc used to present research, lessons learned, or
    systemic analysis
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Presentations are meant to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Showcase technical contributions and research.</li>
  <li>Share lessons learned, both from successes and failures.</li>
  <li>Highlight community initiatives and needs.</li>
  <li>
    Educate and inspire discussion by surfacing new perspectives or practical
    techniques.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Some of the high level categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Failed PostgreSQL projects and what you learned from them</li>
  <li>Proof-of-concept features and performance improvements</li>
  <li>Academic database research</li>
  <li>Long-form surveys and analyses of PostgreSQL problems</li>
  <li>Architectural issues in PostgreSQL and how to fix them</li>
  <li>New perspectives on systemic community concerns</li>
  <li>Educational content and how-tos</li>
  <li>Missing features and user needs</li>
</ul>

<h5>Submission Notes</h5>
<ul>
  <li>
    Accepted 50 minute talks confer at most two complimentary registrations. 25
    minute talks confer one complimentary registration.
  </li>
  <li>
    Please propose your presentation as either a 50 minute or 25 minute talk. Do
    not submit the same proposal to both tracks.
  </li>

</div>

<p><em>Deadline Batch 1: January 16, 2026, Batch 2: April 14th, 2026</em></p>

<p>
  Community discussion sessions are interactive sessions where you can discuss
  issues related to Postgres and the community in a meeting format.
</p>
<p>
  These sessions will be scheduled for Tuesday and are a replacement for last
  year's interactive Tuesday content, including the
  <a
    href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2025/schedule/session/314-developer-meeting-invite-only/"
    target="_blank">Developer Meeting</a
  >, the
  <a
    href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2025/schedule/session/404-postgres-community-summit/"
    target="_blank">Community Summit</a
  >, and the
  <a
    href="https://www.pgevents.ca/events/pgconfdev2025/schedule/session/241-extension-ecosystem-summit/"
    target="_blank">Extension Ecosystem Summit</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  Community Discussion Sessions may concern any topic related to the Postgres
  community and Postgres ecosystem. While these sessions build on last year’s
  content, don't feel limited to previous topics. We’re eager to see new ideas
  that expand the conversation.
</p>
<p>Their format should fall under one of the three following categories:</p>

<article>
  <header>
    <h4>Open Discussion Sessions</h4>
  </header>

  <p>
    All seats are are open to anyone. Meeting size is subject only to room size.
  </p>
  <p><em>Example: The future of pg_stat_statements</em></p>
</article>

<article>
  <header>
    <h4>Working Groups</h4>
  </header>

  <p>
    A small number of seats are reserved for invited members of the working
    group. The remaining slots are open to all conference attendees but seating
    will be organized to maximize collaboration amongst invited attendees.
    Please list invited participants in body of submission.
  </p>
  <p><em>Example: Can the community support additional batch executors?</em></p>
</article>

<article>
  <header>
    <h4>Closed Sessions</h4>
  </header>

  <p>
    These sessions are for invited participants only and meant to create a
    focused, productive and private discussion among those already involved in
    the topic. Please list invited participants in body of submission.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Example: Security committee discussing the impact of recent CVE</em>
  </p>
</article>

<h5>Submission Notes</h5>

<ul>
  <li>
    Community discussion sessions do not confer complimentary registration.
  </li>
  <li>
    All invited attendees must be listed in the body of your proposal. Please
    secure invitees' consent prior to submitting your proposal. Organizers will
    do their best to avoid conflicts between meetings with overlapping key
    attendees.
  </li>
  <li>
    There are two CFP rounds for Community Discussion Sessions. Round one closes
    January 16, with most sessions chosen then. Round two closes April 14 to
    allow for late-breaking issues. Proposals not accepted in round one
    automatically roll over, so early submission improves your chances.
  </li>

<p>

<h2>Submission Rules and Tips</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Disclose if any portion of your session concerns closed source code.</li>

    Proposed talks about your company's product are unlikely to be accepted
    unless they focus on how PostgreSQL could be modified to make it easier to
    extend and support.
  </li>
  <li>
    Describe in your bio what makes you uniquely positioned to deliver the
    content you are proposing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Community Discussion Sessions and Panels should feature individuals from
    multiple companies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Check out the PGConf.dev 2025
    <a href="https://2025.pgconf.dev/schedule.html" target="_blank">schedule</a>
